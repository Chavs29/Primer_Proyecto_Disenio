A cloud database is a type of database service that is deployed, delivered, and accessed through the cloud. These databases are hosted on a remote server and can be accessed by users over the internet. Cloud databases are used to organize, store, and manage both structured and unstructured data, as well as semi-structured data.\n\nUnlike traditional on-premises databases, cloud databases do not require physical hardware or infrastructure to store data. This makes them more flexible and scalable, as users can easily increase or decrease the storage capacity of their databases as needed.\n\nCloud databases also offer a range of benefits, including increased accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and improved data security. Overall, cloud databases have become increasingly popular in recent years as more organizations look to move their data storage to the cloud for greater efficiency and agility.
