Contenido:A cloud database is a database that is deployed, delivered, and accessed in the cloud. Cloud databases organize and store structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data just like traditional on-premises databases. However, they also provide many of the same benefits of cloud computing, including speed, scalability, agility, and reduced costs.
